"For professional reasons, I won't be able to work on my mods anymore. I was hoping that after v1.0, Mojang would simplify the update process for modders or at least stop updating the game every two weeks, but it's not the case.
Here are the sources for those who would like to update themselves:
Kaevator SuperSlopes Sources 1.2.3 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/35440450/Kaevator_SuperSlopes_Sources_1.2.3.zip
Kaevator Timber Frames Sources 1.2.3 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/35440450/Kaevator_TimberFrames_Sources_1.2.3.zip
Kaevator Wallpaper Sources 1.2.3 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/35440450/Kaevator_Wallpaper_Sources_1.2.3.zip
Kaevator Hedges & Shears Sources Beta 1.7.3 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/35440450/Kaevator_Hedges_Sources_Beta_1.7.3.zip

Since the last version, SuperSlopes mod lighting doesn't match the game one.
You can use these sources for anything, you can also mix them to make a mod package.

I won't be able to answer to my message anymore (that won't change a lot!)
Cheers!
